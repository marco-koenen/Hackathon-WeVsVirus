This prototype is developed with [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and build with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). If you're already up and running with most of the usual Node ecosystem tools this project won't require much additional effort.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>
In order to simplify the installation process you should install Homebrew which provides a friendly Homebrew CLI workflow for the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries. Simply paste following line in your terminal.

```shell
"/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)""
```
<br/>

## 🔧 Install dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>
[Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager for our code. It allows us to use and share code with other developers from around the world. Npm, does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you don’t ever have to worry. You can easily install npm with Homebrew. (it comes along with Node.js)

```shell
brew install node
```

Install all package dependencies with yarn.

```shell
npm install
```
<br/>

## ⚙️ Build system <a name="build"></a>
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is an extremely powerful tool for automating tasks from the command line. Configuration is handled by a single file: ``settings.yml``. If you leave the directory structure intact, there won't be too much that needs changing here. When you are ready - run ``npm start`` and start hacking!
<br/><br/>

## 🚀 Tasks <a name="tasks"></a>

* ``npm start`` watch all files and run browser-sync.
* ``npm run build`` build a working copy of the source files.
* ``npm run deploy`` minify and optimize all source files and deploy them to the production branch
* ``npm run clean`` clean build folder
* ``npm run fresh`` fresh node_modules install
* ``npm run bump`` bump to a new version (patch)
